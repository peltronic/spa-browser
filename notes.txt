UI

browse: 
    ~ go to root/home
    ~ go to child node
    ~ go to sibling node (next, prev)
    ~ go to parent node
    ~ view ( think mac finder ): simple parent, sibling, children links display with a "you are here"
    ~ distiguish folders from files

search:
    ~ recursive from current directory
    ~ set depth of search
    ~ search for type file, folder, or both?
    ~ display results, both folders and files, indicate which is which. 
        o click on folder takes you to folder
        o click on file takes you to folder, previews file (?)

Questions

server side file permissions?
choosing home directory: only valid under a certain root folder (or a set of root folders, to make permissions easy)

depth limit (for recursion)
