GET     /index?src=root/foo/bar
GET     /view?src=root/foo/bar/file.txt
GET     /search?root=root/foo/bar&q=myfile
POST    /copy?src=root/foo/file1.txt&dst=root/bar

%%% UI

browse: 
    ~ go to root/home
    ~ go to child node
    ~ go to sibling node (next, prev)
    ~ go to parent node
    ~ view ( think mac finder ): simple parent, sibling, children links display with a "you are here" (current view)
        o "current view" : show file & folder counts
    ~ distiguish folders from files

search:
    ~ recursive from current directory
    ~ set depth of search
    ~ search for type file, folder, or both?
    ~ display results, both folders and files, indicate which is which. 
        o click "navigate icon" for folder takes you to folder
        o click "preview icon" for  file takes you to folder, previews file (?)


move file:
    ~ need from and to folders
    ~ click "select icon" for file selects the file
    ~ selection appears in "sidebar"
    ~ navigate to destination
    ~ select "move here" icon, only visible if a selection is present

download file:
    ~ in file "view" mode only, icon to download

upload file:
    ~ in current folder, 'upload' icon adds files (not folders) to that folder

move folder:

corner cases:
    ~ move/copy/delete root folder not allowed
    ~ one selection at at time only

TDD:
    ~ plan it but don't write tests
    ~ api tests

State on client, not server!

Agile/Sprints:
    [ ] TBD

Misc:
    [ ] security: sanitize request input
    [ ] implement api under api folder (www/api)

Questions

server side file permissions?
choosing home directory: only valid under a certain root folder (or a set of root folders, to make permissions easy)

depth limit (for recursion)

use classes & namespaces on PHP side

design pattern?

hide comlexity

decoupling

%%% inheritance

    - fsItem implements movable, copyable, delteable
        - folder/directory
        - file


icons can be text in this skeleton UI
