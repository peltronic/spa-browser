The task is to create a web service API that allows users to query the contents of a directory on the web server and a single page web app that can be used to search and browse folders and files. A server side home directory should be configurable via variable.
Client Side, the application should be deep-linkable (the state of the UI should be kept in the URL). All of the UI work should be done client side via JavaScript that renders HTML - do not render HTML server side (no
 ASPX, etc). Styling is not as important for this task, we are more concerned with functionality. Keep framework usage to a minimum, but feel free to use Knockout, jQuery and jQuery UI if it helps.
The goal is to produce a functional proof-of-concept to let us see how you think. It is important to provide a decent body of code, so that we can talk about the logic than it is to make it “pretty”.
The point of this exercise is to end up with a body of work that is big enough that our team can review it and evaluate your design and coding style and skills.
Sample Functional Requirements
In this example we would want a developer to implement both server side and client side logic in a primitive end to end flow that runs without errors for a few small features. If you chose to submit a project, the goal is to show a working proof of concept with enough C# and JavaScript code that we can get a feel for your coding style and have some interesting classes to discuss in a code review. You may delete all the default controllers and files you are not using, as it may help us focus on your code
Primary Requirements
● Ensure your solution builds in Visual Studio 2017
● Web API that allows Browse and Search Files & Folders and returns JSON
● Deep linkable URL pattern
● SPA (Single Page App using JavaScript)
● Upload/download files from the browser
● Show file and folder counts and sizes for the current view
● No third party plugins. (Knockout, jQuery and jQueryUI are not requirements but can be used.)
Secondary Requirements
● Entire component contained in a dialog widget, with a trigger element (button, etc)
● Delete, Move, Copy files and folders
● Performance - we highly value performance
● Any other cool stuff you want to show!


=========================

Slide Deck Presentation Details:
    ○ Illustrate your approach to eliciting more detailed requirements
    ○ Describe execution methodologies and tools, (e.g., Agile and Jira)
    ○ Illustrate workflows or communication strategies with developers, managers and the customer
        ■ Be able to characterize how you handle customer interactions
        ■ Demonstrate how you decompose the project into milestones and deliveries
        ■ Illustrate how you document the project for different audiences
    ○ Describe best approach to project risk management (schedule, technology decisions, ad-hoc requirements, etc.)
    ○ Describe how you mitigate risk and failure
    ○ Provide an illustrated and annotated mock-up of the software user interface based on the sample project requirements.

=========================

%%% Illustrate your approach to eliciting more detailed requirements

=> Assumption: we have recieved some initial customer requirements in written form. Very loose & quick, almost brainstorming ideas of what the functionality the product has and getting them on 'paper'. Words & pictures, diagrams.  

https://www.bridging-the-gap.com/user-experience-techniques/
identify roles/actors, data sources, data sinks, blocks of logic (black boxes)
role playing / user stories
prototype, minimially-viable (fast, agile)
mockups (fast, agile)

%%%

Agile:

A loose form of scrum, agile-like

Jira:

%%% misc thoughts

~ identify what 'blocks' modules we have built already and can be used, or are available as 3rd-party libraries and can simply be plugged-in (example: Pluuploader).
~ identify tools and frameworks to make development more efficient and not re-invent the wheel so-to-say (eg, Twitter Bootstrap 4, KnockoutJS, VueJS, etc).
~ unknown/un-discovered requirements, integration?
~ execution, release/integration, unknown

%%% Illustrate workflows or communication strategies with developers, managers and the customer
    ■ Be able to characterize how you handle customer interactions
    ■ Demonstrate how you decompose the project into milestones and deliveries
    ■ Illustrate how you document the project for different audiences

Slack (or equiv)
email 
phone calls, or Slack with screenshare
Google Docs, Sheets (or equiv)...real time updating in the cloud
in-person

Milestones, Deliveries

staging delivery vs production delivery

document the project for different audiences
    ~ technical : schedule at sprint level, user stories w/ technical supplemenation, other technical requirements and details, reasons behind features and functionality (important for context! see SCRUM book)
    ~ non-technical: user stories (w/o technical supplemntation/notes), milestones
    ~ management/financial: milestone level, risk management, costs

%%% Describe best approach to project risk management (schedule, technology decisions, ad-hoc requirements, etc.)

%%% Describe how you mitigate risk and failure


** gating issues, dependencies: ensure developers are working in parallel as much as possible as opposed to serially.

Testing/TDD
Transparency (?)
Prioritization : for example a project has features A, B, and C. A is medium complexity and high priority, a must-have without which the application has no reason to exist. C on the other hand is somewhat complex and low priority. Not to say it isn't important, but A and B can work without C, whose functionality can be handled manually if necessary.  In this scenario the team would work on A and B first and C last. While the goal would still be to deliver on-schedule, if unknown issues should arise, we'd still be able to release a viable product (with A and B) on-time and enhance it subsequently with feature C.
